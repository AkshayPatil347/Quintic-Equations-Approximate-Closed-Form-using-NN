# Quintic-Equations-Approximate-Closed-Form-using-NN

One can find the exact equations of chebyshev and the LAgragian NN directly for each of the above code block , 
but for the Conventional NN architechtures used above one can use the 'Deterministic Interpretation of NN' and 'Exact Equations of the NN' papers...

Conclusion - Do the quintic equations have the algebraic equations of mapping from the coefficient space to the root space ? Exactly no , but approximately yes by NN
with errors in prediction... But more research is needed varying the architectures by Neural Architecture Search of the three methods of 1. Conventional NN , 2. Chebyshev Activation NN (Deterministic Interpretation of NN)
3. Lagrangian NN (Probabilistic Interpretation of NN) (this method is yet to be implemented for this problem)...to find the respective optimum architectures in the three methods for the given generated dataset of polynomial.
